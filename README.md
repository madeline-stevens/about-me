# about-me
On day 4, 6/8/17, Zach was the DRIVER when editing my code for my about me site, and I was the NAVIGATOR.
We worked together to add functions to my seven questions. We worked quickly and efficiently. We even had time to break things. Mostly me breaking things. There was an odd thing that happened when I was trying to pull our changes down onto my computer and apparently I didn't include git add . before git commit -m "This is Maddy committing function changes to Zachs about me" then I was intending to git pull origin master but the functions were showing up in github already? So we were a little perplexed as to how. We fixed that with Adrian's help. Then another issue was that I had been making changes to my master copy on my computer while we were making the real changes on zach's computer. This created a conflict after the pull finally worked. I had to delete some conflict messages on my original before I could open in browser from index.html.
